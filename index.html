**Description:**
Involving a meticulous process, the Barista Coffee Experience project aimed to revolutionize the standard coffee-making routine by integrating modern technology with traditional brewing methods. The project focused on enhancing both the quality of coffee and the overall customer experience in a café setting.

**What I Did:**

- **Design and Implementation**: Designed a user-friendly interface for an automated coffee machine, ensuring it replicated the precision of a skilled barista.
- **Training**: Developed a training program for staff to maintain consistency and quality in manual brewing methods, complementing the automated system.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Hardware**: Automated coffee machines with programmable settings for grind size, water temperature, and brewing time.
- **Software**: Custom software developed using Python and JavaScript to control the automated coffee machine and provide real-time analytics on coffee quality and customer preferences.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze customer feedback and adjust brewing parameters for optimal taste.

**Outcome:**
- **Enhanced Coffee Quality**: Achieved a significant improvement in the consistency and quality of coffee served, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced the time required for each cup of coffee, allowing staff to focus more on customer service and less on the technical aspects of brewing.
